Project Tasks
Task 0: Square with Size
This task creates a Square class with a private instance attribute size. The class will be instantiated with a size value, and explores the significance of private attributes.

File: 0-square.py

Task 1: Size Validation
This task enhances the Square class by adding validation for the size attribute during instantiation. The class will raise TypeError and ValueError exceptions for invalid inputs.

File: 1-square.py

Task 2: Area of a Square
This extends the Square class by adding a public instance method area that calculates and returns the area of the square based on its size.

File: 2-square.py

Task 3: Access and Update Private Attribute
This task implements getter and setter methods for the private size attribute. These methods will allow controlled access and modification of the size attribute, while enforcing type and value validation.

File: 3-square.py

Task 4: Printing a Square
This task adds a public instance method my_print to the Square class. This method will print a visual representation of the square using the # character. The method will also handle cases where the size is 0.
