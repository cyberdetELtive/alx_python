# Python Import and Exception Handling Projects

Welcome to a collection of Python projects that cover various aspects of importing modules and handling exceptions. This repository offers practical exercises to enhance your skills in managing imports and dealing with exceptions in Python programming.

## Project 0: Importing a Simple Function

This project demonstrates the process of importing a function from an external file and utilizing it for a specific task. It introduces you to basic import concepts and string formatting for output display.

### Project Structure

- `python-import_modules/`
  - `0-add.py`: Imports the `add` function and performs addition.
  - ...

## Project 1: Making a Script Dynamic

In this project, you'll explore command-line arguments and their handling. By utilizing the `argv` list, you'll learn how to display the number and list of arguments passed to a Python script.

### Project Structure

- `python-import_modules/`
  - `1-args.py`: Prints the number and list of command-line arguments.
  - ...

## Project 2: Everything Can Be Imported

This project focuses on importing variables from external files. You'll import the variable `a` from a separate file and print its value. This provides insight into importing and using variables defined elsewhere.

### Project Structure

- `python-import_modules/`
  - `2-variable_load.py`: Imports the variable `a` and prints its value.
  - ...

## Project 3: Integers Division with Debug

Here, you'll develop a function to perform integer division and print the result. By using the `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks, you'll gain experience in handling exceptions and displaying division results.

### Project Structure

- `python-import_modules/`
  - `3-safe_print_division.py`: Defines the `safe_print_division` function for division and result printing.
  - ...

## Project 4: Raise Exception

In this project, you'll explore raising exceptions intentionally. By creating a function that raises a type exception, you'll understand how to handle and identify specific error scenarios.

### Project Structure

- `python-import_modules/`
  - `4-raise_exception.py`: Contains the `raise_exception` function to raise a type exception.
  - ...

## Project 5: Raise a Message

This project focuses on raising exceptions with custom messages. By creating a function that raises a name exception along with a specified message, you'll learn to provide meaningful error information.

### Project Structure

- `python-import_modules/`
  - `5-raise_exception_msg.py`: Defines the `raise_exception_msg` function for raising exceptions with messages.
  - ...
