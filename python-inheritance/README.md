Python Inheritance Project
This project focuses on understanding inheritance in Python by creating different classes and exploring their relationships. The goal is to implement classes and methods that demonstrate the concepts of class inheritance and method overriding.

Task 0: Exact Same Object
Implements a function is_same_class(obj, a_class) that checks if an object is an exact instance of a specified class.

Task 1: Same Class or Inherit From
Creates a function is_kind_of_class(obj, a_class) that checks if an object is an instance of a class or a class inherited from another specified class.

Task 2: Only Subclass of
Designs a function inherits_from(obj, a_class) to determine if an object is an instance of a class that inherits (directly or indirectly) from a specified class.

Task 3: Geometry Module
Creates an empty class BaseGeometry as a starting point for further development.

Task 4: Improve Geometry
Enhances the BaseGeometry class by adding a public instance method area(self) that raises an Exception with the message "area() is not implemented".

Task 5: Integer Validator
Extends the BaseGeometry class with a public instance method integer_validator(self, name, value) to validate an integer value.

Task 6: Rectangle
Implements a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry. The class should be instantiated with width and height values.

Task 7: Full Rectangle
Builds on the Rectangle class by implementing the area() method and customizing the print() and str() methods to provide a rectangle description.

Task 8: Square #1
Creates a class Square that inherits from the Rectangle class. The class should be instantiated with a size value.

Each task involves writing classes and methods to showcase different aspects of inheritance and class relationships. The main focus is on understanding the concepts and implementing them without the use of external modules. Each task builds on the previous ones, gradually expanding the knowledge of inheritance in Python.
