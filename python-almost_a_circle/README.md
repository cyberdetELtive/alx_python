# Almost a Circle - Python Project

This project is a part of the ALX Software Engineering program and focuses on building a class hierarchy to manage rectangles and squares. The project aims to demonstrate understanding of class inheritance, encapsulation, validation, and proper documentation in Python.

## Description

The project involves creating a class hierarchy with the following classes:
- `Base`: A base class that manages the `id` attribute for other classes.
- `Rectangle`: Inherits from `Base` and represents a rectangle with width, height, and position attributes.
- `Square`: Inherits from `Rectangle` and represents a special case of a rectangle where width and height are the same.

Each class is designed to adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines, provide proper documentation, and ensure attribute validation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `models/`: The directory containing class implementations.
  - `base.py`: Defines the `Base` class.
  - `rectangle.py`: Defines the `Rectangle` class.
  - `square.py`: Defines the `Square` class.

- `0-main.py`: Test script for Task 0.
- `1-main.py`: Test script for Task 1.
- ...
- `10-main.py`: Test script for Task 10.
