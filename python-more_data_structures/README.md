Welcome to the alx_python project repository's python-more_data_structures directory! This repository contains a set of Python tasks aimed at enhancing your understanding of data structures and manipulation. Each task focuses on a specific skill and demonstrates your proficiency in solving problems using Python. Let's dive into the tasks!

Task 0: Squared Simple
Description: This task involves creating a function that computes the square value of all integers within a given matrix. The function takes a 2-dimensional array as input and returns a new matrix with each value being the square of the corresponding input value. The initial matrix remains unmodified.

Task 1: Present in Both
Description: This task requires creating a function that identifies the common elements present in two sets. The function takes two sets as input and returns a set containing the common elements.

Task 2: Update Dictionary
Description: This task requires writing a function that updates a dictionary by either adding a new key-value pair or replacing the value of an existing key. The function takes a dictionary, a key, and a value as input, and performs the necessary update operations.

Task 3: Best Score
Description: This task involves writing a function that returns the key associated with the largest integer value in a dictionary. If no score is found, the function returns None.

Function Prototype: def best_score(a_dictionary)

Task 4: Multiply by Using Map
Description: This task requires creating a function that returns a new list where each value is the result of multiplying the corresponding value from an input list by a given number. This should be done without using any loops.

Function Prototype: def multiply_list_map(my_list=[], number=0)
