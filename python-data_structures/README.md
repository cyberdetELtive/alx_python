Python Data Structures Project
This repository contains a collection of Python functions aimed at practicing and improving my skills in manipulating strings and lists of lists. The tasks are part of ALX Intro to software engineering project and cover various aspects of Python programming.

Task 0: Removing 'c' and 'C' from a String
In this task, I am required to write a function that removes all occurrences of the characters 'c' and 'C' from a given string. The function should not use any imported modules or the str.replace() method.

Task 1: Printing a Matrix of Integers
For this task, my goal is to implement a function that prints a matrix of integers in a specified format. The function should use the str.format() method to print integers and should not rely on any imported modules.

Task 2: Returning Length and First Character of a Sentence
In this task, I am required to create a function that returns a tuple containing the length of a given string and its first character. If the sentence is empty, the first character in the tuple should be None.
